I am an incoming **Assistant Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Oregon** starting in January 2026. My group will develop image-guided interventions for the diagnosis and treatment of disease, with a special focus on investigating the immunological effects of high-intensity sound waves across diverse tissue microenvironments, including wounds and infections.

**I will be recruiting team members at all levels starting January 2026, including undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and research staff. If you are interested in working with me, please don’t hesitate to get in touch — no prior ultrasound experience is necessary!**

I am currently concluding my Glasstone Research Fellowship in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, working in the BUBBL lab under the supervision of Profs. Eleanor Stride and Constantin Coussios.

Outside of the lab, I love hiking and trail running, baking elaborate new desserts, and reading (preferably with a cat on my lap).
